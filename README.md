# Readme (TODO)
Splits up an mbox file generated by google takeout, into multiple smaller mbox files representing email folders.
    
Sorting uses an allow list and a block list, both using gmail labels. If an email has any of the labels on the block
list, then it is discarded immediately. Otherwise it will be added to a folder using the first label on the allow
list which it matches. If it doesn't match any labels in the allow list it will be discarded (unless you pass -m)
